# Tier Curator 
**This is a project I started cause I hated needing an account on Tiermaker.com to share my templates with my friends.**

You can import images from your device or use links to images hosted online as Icons. Then you can sort those images on to a custom-made tier list, as you would expect for a Tier List Editor

The main feature of this site- and the reason I made it -was the Permalink feature.
After making a tier list you can click the `Template as URL` button to have a URL copied to your clipboard. That URL contains all the tiers and icons* you added, allowing you to share the link with anyone.<br>
<sub>*Only supports icons imported from web links. Images imported from device will not be added to the url</sub>

If you have any feedback/problems, please open an issue. I'd appreciate some feedback.
